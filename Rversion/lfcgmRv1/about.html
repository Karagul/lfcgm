The app plots a player's age against the league goals that the player scored in a top level season.
You can generate your own plots simply by selecting one or more players from the dropdown list on the Plot tab.
You can compare players across different seasons and eras.  Enjoy :-).
</p>
        
<p>
The player dropdown list contains all of the LFC players who have scored a top level league goal in more than one season, from 1894-95 to 2014-15.
The top level is the old 1st Division or the Premier League.
That's 233 LFC players, from Alan A'Court to Yossi Benayoun.
The player's age used in the plots is their age at the season mid-point, taken to be 1st January.

It is deployed on R Studio's platform.
The original implementation was built using python, spyre, pandas and ggplot. 
It was deployed on Heroku's cloud application platform.
