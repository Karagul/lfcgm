# lfcgm

The Liverpool Football Club Goal Machine (lfcgm) is an interactive python Spyre app that takes the selected LFC player and plots the player's Age against League Goals per season. 

The app runs at <a href="http://lfcgm.herokuapp.com/">lfcgm.herokuapp.com</a>. 

You can find out more about Spyre at <a href="https://github.com/adamhajari/spyre">github.com/adamhajari/spyre</a>.

For more information about the supporting data analysis see the lfcgm IPython notebook (work in progress).
